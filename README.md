# Spring-Mechs

## Why am I doing this?
I am doing this to demonstrate my ability to:
- create a Java API with full CRUD capability,
- run tests of Java applications (Spring, Postman),
- use industry-standard version control (Git and GitHub),
- use industry-standard planning- and development-tracking tools (Jira).
## How I expected the challenge to go
I expected the challenge to be fairly straight-forward and to have the project finished within 3 days.
## What went well? / What didn't go as planned?

###What went well

- Building the app and using the main-dev-feature branch model for version control was very intuitive for me and I practiced this well.
- I found utilising Jira to be very helpful in tracking the development of the project and I used it well.

###What didn't go as planned

- I had several issues with running integration tests on the API, which meant it took me much longer than I planned for to complete the testing section.
- There were a few minor bugs in the app which were only highlighted by Maven when trying to build the .jar file. This took a long time to resolve.
## Possible improvements for future revisions of the project
Include more explicit, distinct comments in the application code so that I can be sure of that part of the code's intended functionality. This makes it much easier to return to and to debug.
